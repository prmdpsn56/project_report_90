# Project Report 90%
we are working on the project and are now working on making the final features.We have been able to visualse the data using the fusion charts and php as the backend language.We are now working on feature that would show the user the list of specific medicines (for example: medicines related to fever).We want to show the medicines upon selection of a option and then showing a list of suggested medicines and description about the same and showing a fusion chart representing the medicines that we will be selling and the ones that we have in stock(and show how much have that left in the stock in both individual quantity and relative percentage).

## Things that well
#### 1.Database Design and Implementaion
#### 2.Database visualisation using fusion charts.

## Things that didnt went well/minor issues

#### 1.The visualisation of different suggested medicines according to the specific health problem type.
#### 2.Creation of tables inside a user database when the user signup.

## Interesting Things
The fusion charts map feature can be used to show and which medicines are trending in different regions of the world.We tried it
using our local database.It was working somewhat fine but the data needs to be legit.We might add this feature if the project finishes before the planned deadline but for now its going somewhat behind the schedule so we might not add that.
